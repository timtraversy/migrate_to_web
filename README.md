# Migrate To Web
![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/migrate_to_web.svg)

Automatially migrate your current Flutter projects to be compatible with Flutter Web. The current workflow suggested by the Flutter team is to create a copy of your app's code and change it according to their [migration guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter_web/blob/master/docs/migration_guide.md). This tool automates all those steps and creates a nice little Flutter Web project out of your current one.

#### How To use it
From the root of your flutter project run

    flutter pub run migrate_to_web

This will automatically create a project in the same parent directory with the suffix `_web`.

To use a different name for the web project, use the argument `-n or --name`.

    flutter pub run migrate_to_web -n my_web_project

If you make changes to your project, just run the same command and it will update the web project.

To finish the project set up, all you need to do is run `flutter packages get` in that directory, and upload any font files you were using into the `fonts` folder

#### To-do
- [x] Handle fonts
- [ ] Handle assets
- [ ] Add tests for updating situations
